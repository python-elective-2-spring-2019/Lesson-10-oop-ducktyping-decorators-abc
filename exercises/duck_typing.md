# Exercise: Adding skills by using the Duck Typing approach

* Create a game where a player after some event has occourd (ie. winning or losing) can choose new skills (get a sword, recieve some money ie.) or if loosing can lose some already accuired skills.

For this you should make use Pythons dynamic and duck typing abilyties.

Keep it simple - the point is to get "hands on" experience on how to do this in Python.

* When this is working, try to add new skills to the application. (not at runtime)
